Open index.html to view project output. <br />

This project is an introduction to HTML and CSS including how to create headings, paragraphs, and lists. <br />
I also worked on how to outline and align elements as well as embed and link urls to the page. <br />
Basic CSS selectors are also tackled such as margins, paddings, colors, and font styles.
